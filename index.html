There are tutorials listed below on how to use different platforms such as Github, Docker, and Ubuntu so you can dive into these platforms immediately.</p>
<h2 id="Getting-Started"><a href="#Getting-Started" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><ol>
<li><a href="git-github.md">Set up GitHub</a></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Github, using Git, which is an open source version control software, allows individuals to work on the same project simutaneously. Github, the site you are on right now, allows teams to work together on projects and provides a web interface for Git.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><a href="setup-ubuntu.md">Set up Ubuntu</a></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu is a open source operating system that is meant to be a more user-friendly version of other desktop Linux distributions. It was created in 2004 and the word ‘Ubuntu’ comes from the African Nguni language and translates to “humanity to others”. Its name has proven to be useful to more than just people, as Ubuntu is used for servers, cloud platforms and IoT devices. In this tutorial you will download WSL2, which will allow you to use Ubuntu on your device.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><a href="about-docker.md">Set up Docker</a></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Docker is a platform that packages applications into containers, which is known as containerization (you can read more about that <a href="virtualization-containerization.md">here</a>. It is used mainly by individual users and only requires one server to function.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>This page covers basic computer terms and componenets and explains them in an easy to understand way. It covers the basis of how computers work, which will help you understand other concepts in this wiki, such as containerization.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="virtualization-containerization.md">About Virtualization and Containerization</a></p>
<ul>
<li>This page covers virtualization, which in essence allows your physical computer to act as multiple separate computers. Containerization is the process of taking code and turning into in a portable unit, which are called containers. The idea of containerization started in the early 2000s, but didn’t really make any headway until the creation of Docker and Kubernetes in the 2010s.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="about-12factorapp.md">About the Twelve Factor App</a></p>
<ul>
<li>This page covers the Twelve Factor App methodology, which is a set of principles regarding how a developer should create an application. It was created in the early 2010s in response to the transition into cloud computing, where traditional software principles did not apply. Developers from Heroku helped create the Twelve Factor App, which lists key principles that a developer should follow, its goal is to deter common mistakes that are made in the application building process, and help developers find solutions to their issues.</li>

They have been created over time by developers who have worked on numerous apps, and want to help other developers avoid common issues when building apps, provide definitions for terminology, and offer solutions to problems that a developer might face in the development process. As the title states, it gives twelve different steps from beginning to end on how to build an application, and goes into depth of each step and why it is necessary to go through it. </p>
<h2 id="History-of-the-Twelve-Factor-App"><a href="#History-of-the-Twelve-Factor-App" class="headerlink" title="History of the Twelve Factor App"></a>History of the Twelve Factor App</h2><p>The origin of the Twelve Factor App started back in 2011, where developers that worked on Heroku, a platform as a service (PaaS), were dealing with the transition into cloud computing. Since cloud computing dealt with applications on a different scale to traditional software computing, developers were left confused as they tried to apply traditional methods to this transitional period. As a result, Heroku engineers began to create their twelve factor methodology, which encompassed cloud computing issues like scalability, consistency between development and production, and lifecycle management. With their experience as engineers and developers at the forefront of cloud computing, they combined all their knowledge to make these steps so that others could follow their guidelines in order to create fully functional applications that are suited for the cloud. The creators of the Twelve Factor App have stated that they took inspiration for the structure from Martin Fowler’s <em>‘Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture’</em> and <em>‘Refactoring’</em>, which are about the patterns and practices that developers should use so it is easier to create useful software. </p>

Docker is a *containerization* platform.

<p>  <strong>Containerization</strong>: The process of packaging source code into an executable container</p>
<ul>
<li>Kubernetes is used by larger infrastructures and requires at least 3 servers to run applications</li>
<li>Docker is best for individual users and smaller infrastructures, requires only 1 server</li>
</ul>
<p>  <strong>Container</strong>: The executable, packaged source code&#x2F;software. Similar to a Virtual Machine (VM), but does not simulate an entire computer</p>
<p>  <strong>Registry</strong>: Stores and distributes named Docker images, organized into repositories. Repositories hold versions of an image, identified by tags</p>
<ul>
<li>Docker Hub is the official, public registry, and is used by default</li>
</ul>
<p>  <strong>Image</strong>: Similar to a snapshot for VMs, it acts as a static template for containers</p>
<p>  <strong>Layer</strong>: The difference between an old and new image, manually created after using <code>docker commit</code> to commit file changes</p>
<ul>
<li><code>docker commit [options/flags] CONTAINER [REPOSITORY[:TAG]]</code></li>
<li>NOTE: images are static (you cannot edit them), so any changes made must be saved to a new image!</li>
</ul>
<p>  <strong>Docker Daemon</strong>: The background process running on the OS, executing Docker tasks. Configured using the Docker Desktop settings page, or through a JSON file</p>
<p>  <strong>Docker Client</strong>: The primary way of interacting with Docker. The Client sends commands to <code>dockerd</code> (the Docker daemon)</p>
<ul>
<li>Client can communicate to multiple daemons</li>
</ul>

Docker is an open-source tool that is compatible with GitHub features. While Kubernetes have greater scaling and is used for larger operations, Docker is ideal for personal use and for smaller companies and cloud infrastructures that prioritize portable workloads.

</ul>
<h2 id="What-is-Git"><a href="#What-is-Git" class="headerlink" title="What is Git?"></a>What is Git?</h2><p>Git is  Version Control System (VCS)</p>
<p><img src="/is373-project/images/git-logo.png" alt="Git Logo"></p>
<ul>
<li><em>However</em>, it handles information in a completely different from other VCSs, so you should see Git as a separated concept to avoid confusion</li>
<li>The main difference is that Git uses <strong>Snapshot storage</strong>, while other VCSs typically use <strong>Delta storage</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Snapshot-storage-vs-Delta-storage"><a href="#Snapshot-storage-vs-Delta-storage" class="headerlink" title="Snapshot storage vs. Delta storage"></a>Snapshot storage vs. Delta storage</h4><ul>
<li><p><strong>Snapshot storage</strong>: Git stores data as a stream of snapshots.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each snapshot represents the system state at a given time</li>
<li>Git will store unchanged files as a link to the previous identical files</li>
<li>More simple and efficient, but can consume a lot of storage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Delta storage</strong> (delta-based version control): Other VCMs store data based only on file or system changes, rather than the entire state.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delta</strong>: The difference between the current version and the previous version</li>
<li>All the <strong>deltas</strong> are combined to rebuild a system state</li>
<li>More complex, but can save on storage</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although delta storage is more storage-efficient, snapshot storage makes more sense for getting an accurate, updated representation.</p>
<p>Now, back to Git:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git generally works with your local files and resources; even if you have no internet or VPN access, you can still <code>commit</code> your changes to your local copy<ul>
<li>Other VCMs may allow file edits, but do not allow “offline” database commits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Everything in Git is <strong>checksummed</strong></li>
<li>All changes, incomplete transfers, and file corruptions are detected by Git</li>
<li>Git database stores everything by the <strong>hash value</strong> of its contents, not by file names</li>
<li>Git generally only <code>add</code> data, which improves data recovery by making it difficult to erase committed data</li>
</ul>
<p>Git is the VCS, and GitHub is the one of many remote repository hosting sites.</p>

<h2 id="What-is-GitHub"><a href="#What-is-GitHub" class="headerlink" title="What is GitHub?"></a>What is GitHub?</h2><p>GitHub is a web-based service for hosting <strong>remote repositories</strong></p>
<p><img src="/is373-project/images/github-logo.png" alt="GitHub Logo"></p>
<ul>
<li>You can use Git without GitHub, but GitHub needs Git to work</li>
</ul>
<p>So, why bother using GitHub?</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaboration and Project Management: GitHub improves team collaboration with features like pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking, as well as tracking commit histories to quantify individual contribution</li>
<li>Access Control: You can choose the visibility and access rights of your code</li>
<li>Documentation: GitHub Wikis and readme.md files are available as documentation tools  </li>
<li>Remote repository backup: Even if your machine spontaneously combusts (or you lose your local directory in any way), as long as you have committed your local changes to the remote repository, you will be able to restore your files and directories from anywhere else!</li>
<li><strong>CI&#x2F;CD</strong>: Continues Integration and Continuous Delivery. You can use <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> to automate your workflow to build, test, and deploy</li>
<li>Portfolio &#x2F; Networking: Remote repositories allow sharing of resources, contributions to public projects, and also allow you to showcase your projects and portfolio to peers and companies alike</li>
<li>Web UI: GitHub has a user-friendly web interface, which is a helpful addition to command line controls</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Working Directory</strong>: The working directory, or working tree, is a <code>checkout</code> of a single version (branch) of a project. The files are pulled from a Git directory and placed on the local disk to be used or modified</li>
<li><strong>Staging Area &#x2F; Index</strong>: The staging area stores the changes to be committed. It <em>only</em> prepares to commit changes that you have added for tracking</li>
<li><strong>Repository &#x2F; Git Directory</strong>: After staging all the desired changes, the changes are then committed and then pushed to the Git Directory as a permanent snapshot</li>

<h3 id="What-you-will-need-beforehand"><a href="#What-you-will-need-beforehand" class="headerlink" title="What you will need beforehand:"></a>What you will need beforehand:</h3><ul>
<li>Windows 10&#x2F;11 on virutal or physical machine</li>
<li>Windows updated to most recent version</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. Installing WSL2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The first step to installing Ubuntu on your machine is installing WSL2 on your computer. WSL2 stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux, and it allows you to run a Linux environment on your computer without having to have a separate virtual machine.</li>
<li>To install WSL2, you have to open Windows Terminal on your device as an adminstrator. Then enter <code> wsl --install </code>. </li>
<li>Once it has installed, you must restart your device.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Installing Ubuntu</strong><br>The second step for installing Ubuntu is installing a version of Ubuntu onto WSL. We will be using a method that allows you to install Ubuntu from the command line. </p>
<ul>
<li>First, you must open Windows Terminal and enter <code> wsl --list --online </code> to see on the available versions of Ubuntu that you are able to install.</li>
<li>Once you have found the version that you like, you must type the name of the version that you want and then enter the following: <code> wsl --install -d (name of installation) </code></li>
<li>If successful, you will see a progress bar appear showing that the installation is in progress.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Running Ubuntu</strong><br>The final step for installing Ubuntu is running it on your machine and making sure it is functional. </p>
<ul>
<li>To do that, you must open Powershell terminal and type in the version of Ubuntu you installed, for example: <code> ubuntu2404.exe </code></li>
<li>The Ubuntu terminal should start running, and if it has, then you have successfully installed Ubuntu!</li>
<li>Once it is installed, the system will prompt you to create a username and password. Make sure to write the username and password somewhere secure so then if you forget your information, you are able to retrieve it.</li>
<li>Optionally, you should also run updates for your Ubuntu terminal to make sure that it is up to date. You can run updates by entering the following:<br><code> sudo apt update </code><br><code> sudo apt full-upgrade -y </code></li>
<li>It will prompt you to enter your password for the updates.</li>
</ul>

        <h1 id="What-is-Virtualization"><a href="#What-is-Virtualization" class="headerlink" title="What is Virtualization?"></a>What is Virtualization?</h1><p>Virtualization is a technology that allows one physical machine (like your computer) to act as if it were multiple separate computers, called “virtual machines” (VMs). Each virtual machine runs its operating system and applications, but they all share the physical resources of the host machine, such as CPU, memory, and storage.</p>
<h2 id="Simple-Example"><a href="#Simple-Example" class="headerlink" title="Simple Example:"></a>Simple Example:</h2><p>Imagine you have a house with one big room, but you want to create different workspaces for different tasks, like a kitchen, an office, and a bedroom. Instead of building separate rooms, you could use room dividers to create separate areas within the same space. Each area serves a different purpose, but they all share the same overall space.</p>
<p>In virtualization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The house</strong> &#x3D; the physical machine (your computer or server)</li>
<li><strong>Room dividers</strong> &#x3D; virtualization software (called a “hypervisor”)</li>
<li><strong>Separate areas</strong> &#x3D; virtual machines, each running its operating system and applications</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach helps use resources more efficiently because instead of needing a whole new computer for each task, you can run multiple virtual machines on one physical machine. Virtualization is widely used in modern computing to save money, improve scalability, and increase flexibility in resource use.</p>
<h3 id="History-of-Virtualization"><a href="#History-of-Virtualization" class="headerlink" title="History of Virtualization"></a>History of Virtualization</h3><p>The concept of virtualization dates back to the 1960s when IBM developed it to improve the efficiency of large mainframe computers. Back then, mainframes were costly and limited, so IBM introduced <strong>virtual machines (VMs)</strong> that allowed different users to run separate workloads on the same physical machine.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1960s</strong>: IBM introduces virtualization to allow time-sharing on mainframes, giving multiple users the ability to access computing resources simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>1970s</strong>: Virtualization remained primarily in mainframe environments, as smaller computers like personal computers (PCs) didn’t need this level of resource sharing.</li>
<li><strong>1990s</strong>: As PCs grew in power, companies like VMware began to apply virtualization to servers, enabling more efficient use of resources in data centers.</li>
<li><strong>2000s and Beyond</strong>: Virtualization became mainstream, transforming modern IT infrastructure by enabling <strong>cloud computing</strong>. Today, virtual machines are fundamental to many cloud services, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, helping businesses scale efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<p>From mainframes to modern cloud computing, virtualization has been key in maximizing hardware utilization, reducing costs, and improving flexibility in IT environments.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-Containerization"><a href="#What-is-Containerization" class="headerlink" title="What is Containerization?"></a>What is Containerization?</h1><p>Containerization is a technology that allows developers to package an application and all of its dependencies into a single, portable “container.” This container can run consistently on any system that has the container runtime, making it easier to deploy and run applications across different environments, like development, testing, and production.</p>
<h2 id="Simple-Example-1"><a href="#Simple-Example-1" class="headerlink" title="Simple Example:"></a>Simple Example:</h2><p>Think of containerization like packing a lunchbox:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to bring lunch to work or school. Instead of worrying about whether the fridge or microwave will be available, you pack everything you need (food, utensils, napkins) into a lunchbox.</li>
<li>Now, no matter where you go, you can enjoy your meal without worrying about the kitchen setup.</li>
</ul>
<p>In containerization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The lunchbox</strong> &#x3D; the container, which holds everything the application needs to run (code, libraries, dependencies).</li>
<li><strong>The food and utensils</strong> &#x3D; the application and its dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Wherever you go</strong> &#x3D; any computer or server that has a container runtime (like Docker).</li>
</ul>
<p>By using containers, you ensure the application behaves the same way, no matter where it’s run. Containers are popular in modern software development because they make it easier to run, test, and deploy applications consistently across different environments.</p>
<h2 id="History-of-Containerization"><a href="#History-of-Containerization" class="headerlink" title="History of Containerization"></a>History of Containerization</h2><p>Containerization has roots that date back to the early 2000s, though the concept of isolating applications in environments has existed for much longer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>2000s</strong>: The idea of containerization emerged with <strong>Solaris Zones</strong> (2004) and <strong>Linux Containers (LXC)</strong> (2008). These early technologies allowed for the creation of isolated environments on the same system, where applications could run without interfering with one another.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>2013</strong>: The real breakthrough came with the release of <strong>Docker</strong>, a tool that made containerization simple, portable, and accessible to a wide audience. Docker standardized the container image format and introduced an easy-to-use interface, revolutionizing how developers build, test, and deploy applications.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>2014 and Beyond</strong>: Following Docker’s success, other technologies like <strong>Kubernetes</strong> (developed by Google) emerged to manage and orchestrate containers at a larger scale. This led to the widespread adoption of containerization across various industries, particularly in cloud computing and DevOps.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, containerization is a cornerstone of modern software development, allowing developers to move applications between environments and scale them efficiently and easily.</p>

<h3 id="Key-Differences-from-Virtualization"><a href="#Key-Differences-from-Virtualization" class="headerlink" title="Key Differences from Virtualization:"></a>Key Differences from Virtualization:</h3><p>While virtualization involves creating multiple virtual machines on one physical machine, <strong>containerization</strong> focuses on packaging just the application and its dependencies into lightweight containers. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the same operating system kernel, making them more efficient regarding resource usage.</p>
